# Computational Analysis of Chinese Poetic Form and Innovation

Final project for EAS 407: Hacking Chinese Studies

## Project Overview

This project analyzes formal properties of classical Chinese poetry (Tang, Song, Yuan dynasties) using computational methods. Focus areas:
- Line length distribution
- End-of-line character patterns
- Structural parallelism
- Genre comparison (shi 詩, ci 詞, qu 曲)
